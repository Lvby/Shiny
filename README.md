Predict Heart Disease using Machine Learning Techonologies 

The main aim of this project is to build a system for predictive analysis of heart disease using machine learning algorithms. For this, UCI Heart Disease dataset was used which was available from UCI Machine Learning data repository: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease. The repository from the data folder contains four datasets. They are:
Cleveland Clinic Foundation (cleveland.data)
Hungarian Institute of Cardiology, Budapest (hungarian.data)
V.A. Medical Center, Long Beach, CA (long-beach-va.data)
University Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland (switzerland.data).
